## 📘 Introduction

The 21st century has seen an explosion of data due to technological advancement, giving rise to what we now call Big Data. Each day, massive volumes of information are created and shared via smartphones and smart devices [1].

Human behavior and interaction are largely influenced by beliefs and emotions. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become major channels for expressing opinions—giving rise to **Sentiment Analysis**, also known as opinion mining. This discipline is rooted in **Machine Learning** and **Data Mining** [2].

Due to the growth of internet-based applications, vast amounts of user-generated comments and reviews are produced daily. **Sentiment Analysis** plays a crucial role in identifying, collecting, and categorizing these opinions into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**—providing useful insights for businesses, governments, and individuals [3].

## 🔍 Technical Methodologies of Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis draws from:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Machine Learning (ML)**
- **Text Mining**

### Primary Models in Sentiment Analysis

1. **Keyword-Based Classification**  
   - Relies on polarity words like *happy*, *sad*, *angry*.  
   - Limitations:  
     - Cannot detect negations  
     - Relies on obvious presence of polarity terms [1]

2. **Lexicon-Based Classification**  
   - Builds manually labeled lists of positive/negative words  
   - Assigns sentiment scores based on word polarity  
   - No training data required, but still has limitations [1]

3. **Machine Learning-Based Approach**  
   - Includes supervised and unsupervised algorithms  
   - Steps involved:
     1. **Feature Extraction** – Converts text into valuable features  
     2. **ML Algorithms** – Simulates cognitive processes; common ones:
        - ANN, Random Forest, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, Ensemble Classifiers [1]

## ⚠️ Common Challenges in Sentiment Analysis

1. **Informal Language & Noise**  
   - Social media contains slang, emojis, acronyms  
   - Makes accurate sentiment interpretation difficult [1][3]

2. **Grammatical Errors**  
   - Misspellings and poor grammar obscure meaning [1][3]

3. **Sarcasm & Irony**  
   - Hard to detect tone, e.g., “Oh great, another rainy day” [1][3]

4. **Language & Cultural Differences**  
   - Word meanings change based on context and culture [3]

5. **Data Availability**  
   - Difficult to find high-quality training sets for specific domains

6. **High Computational Costs**  
   - Advanced models require expensive resources [3]
