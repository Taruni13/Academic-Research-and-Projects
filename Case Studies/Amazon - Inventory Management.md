## üìò Introduction

Operational analytics on stock levels and customer demand enables Amazon to optimize its supply chain. By tracking real-time data and performance, they reduce stockouts and improve delivery times, achieving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

---

## üîÅ Process Description

Amazon uses operational analytics to:

- Estimate product demand  
- Schedule resupply  
- Monitor supply reliability  
- Optimize warehouse layouts  
- Manage transportation dynamically  
- Update inventory tracking and return systems

## ‚öôÔ∏è How is Operational Analytics Implemented?

### DSS (Decision Support System)
- Calculates reorder points using forecasted demand  
- Automates replenishment  
- Ensures safety stock levels  

### Inventory Optimization and Re-distribution
- Tracks network-wide stock  
- Redistributes based on demand and efficiency  

### Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts
- Dashboards track KPIs using Amazon QuickSight  
- Alerts managers to demand spikes or stock issues  

### Feedback Loops
- Machine learning improves forecasting over time  
- Uses real-time feedback for inventory rules
